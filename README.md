My-Music-Collection-Stats
=========================

My Music Collection Stats is a private application to provide me with certain stats on my personal music collection. All music is contained in a base folder, with each folder in the base folder representing each artist in the collection. Should that artist's folder already be sorted, it is marked by adding "(Sorted)" after the artist/band's name. Each artist's folder contains their various album releases separated into folders, with each folder named using the album name and prefixed by the year of release (in brackets).
